The alarm woke me up out of conversations in Mandarin, English, and Spanish. It's been a while since I can remember dreaming in any language. It's likely happened and is simply a matter of memory.

This is the first morning of our trip to Deutschland. The vibe is peaceful. The grey blanket turned into a collection of gradient clouds that are low and making way for sunshine. It is nice to see clouds in the sky again. Their continuous movement is meditative.

I walk into a shop in China Town, ask for a mirror because my left contact lens has lodged a speck of dusk underneath it. The woman hands me a mirror, I fix my contact while listening to the Chinese women tell each other that the dog who's lying on the glass counter top looks like a cat. I tell them in Mandarin that I understand, we all chuckle, they switch to Cantonese. Well played. Well played. I'll add that language/dialect to my list.
