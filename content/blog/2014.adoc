== 20141109 - 42

Yesterday was day 42 of LSC 2.0 (lifestyle changes 2.0). I patted myself on the back for walking 9,277 steps beyond 10,000. (!) Walking that much felt good and it was much better than sitting inside all day being antisocial, as the case would have been. While I did not open up http://dailyburn.com[dailyburn.com], a 19,277-step day is not too shabby.

The long walking ended in a wonderful dinner accompanied with wine. A France-sourced friend is in town, which means I yield to his wine recommendations. Dessert was delicious and on the "eat anything" list. That said, I do not eat just anything after having implemented LSC 1.0. When one starts to eat more healthy foods, it becomes noticably easier to avoid making low-quality choices.

In that which follows, I write "you" and "your" because that is how I coach myself via a fountain pen and paper. For example, I write "You can do it!" rather than "I can do it!"

The `5 + 2 = 7` pattern is proving to be easy to maintain since you started it three weeks ago. Although the first change is still fresh, it is clear that you are comfortable moving forward. Health is partially due to regulated consumption and partially due to exercise: `RC + E = H`. The equation includes both. What are these feelings of resistance towards exercise? You mentally resist exercise. Do you need to be convinced of what it can do for you? What if in six weeks of daily exercise you do not see or feel any results. ...that perhaps there is a risk of encountering hopelessness at the end of a six-week experiment. Well, why don't you and I find out? How many days are there within six weeks? `6 x 7 = 42`. Wait, is that the answer to all of life's questions? :) Let's do an experiment for the next 42 days using  daily exercise goals and see what happens. 10,000 steps is the new zero. All steps above that are golden. Real celebration looks like 200 :), 400 :), 600 :), for example.

To make room for this change, you can change the way you study languages:

* (Easy) Download and listen to each 90-minute Hungarian lesson again on your cellphone.
* (Easy) Record the new vocabulary words on SoundCloud.
* (Easy) Create a playlist of the new vocabulary words for easy access.
* (Moderately easy) Write down sentences, have a native speaker review them, and then record them on SoundCloud.
* (Easy) Walk in a quiet area so you can clearly hear the recordings.

You usually have the most success exercising when you do it first thing in the morning. Adjust your wake-up time to 07:30, which is more about consistency than anything else. Workout from 07:45 to 08:15. Take a shower and eat from 08:15 to 08:30. Hop online for your language exchange. After that, the rest of your day is golden.

Since vacationing in Budapest and Serbia, I decided to change my lifestyle. Serbians eat _a lot_ of meat. After three days in Novi Sad, I was tempted to go vegan. Fortunately, that extreme feeling left after I ate green things. While in Budapest, I watched a https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBnniua6-oM[YouTube video called Sugar: The Bitter Truth], which was hauntingly powerful. The topic was familiar to me, but the discussion and diagrams about fructose digestion via the liver were new. As a result, I have eliminated sugar unless it is accompanied by natural fiber, such as a whole (small) orange rather than fresh-squeezed orange juice, and alcohol during the week from Sunday through Thursday. Initially, I tried a Monday through Friday schedule, but that proved to be too difficult given the natural tendency for people to socialize on Fridays and Saturdays. One caveat is that if I exercise intensely for more than one hour, I will take in sugar. However, that is corresponds directly with the activity level underway.

This week, I need to up my game and do more exercise. Now that I have changed my diet, my level of movement needs a boost. I have a subscription to http://dailyburn.com[Daily Burn] and will workout tonight. There, I said it. Now for the _doing_. I can choose to let myself down, or I can choose to follow through. One of my favorite trainers used the prompt, "Let's do something useful." That was such a non-threatening, motivating statement to hear. It is quite easy to be immediately more active. I biked to work today and will bike home too. That is a wonderful baseline, but I need more.

It has been a long time (seven years) since I have owned `infobits.org`, and I now I own `infobits.eu`. Bit by bit, I am porting over content so I can more easily start from scratch with a new site. I am feeling kind of done with blog software Drupal or Wordpress.
