== [[20141109-42]]20141109 - 42

Yesterday was day 42 of LSC 2.0 (lifestyle changes 2.0). I patted myself on the back for walking 9,277 steps beyond 10,000. (!) Walking that much felt good and it was much better than sitting inside all day being antisocial, as the case would have been. While I did not open up http://dailyburn.com[dailyburn.com], a 19,277-step day is not too shabby.

The long walking ended in a wonderful dinner accompanied with wine. A France-sourced friend is in town, which means I yield to his wine recommendations. Dessert was delicious and on the "eat anything" list. That said, I do not eat just anything after having implemented LSC 1.0. When one starts to eat more healthy foods, it becomes noticably easier to avoid making low-quality choices.

In that which follows, I write "you" and "your" because that is how I coach myself via a fountain pen and paper. For example, I write "You can do it!" rather than "I can do it!"

The `5 + 2 = 7` pattern is proving to be easy to maintain since you started it three weeks ago. Although the first change is still fresh, it is clear that you are comfortable moving forward. Health is partially due to regulated consumption and partially due to exercise: `RC + E = H`. The equation includes both. What are these feelings of resistance towards exercise? You mentally resist exercise. Do you need to be convinced of what it can do for you? What if in six weeks of daily exercise you do not see or feel any results. ...that perhaps there is a risk of encountering hopelessness at the end of a six-week experiment. Well, why don't you and I find out? How many days are there within six weeks? `6 x 7 = 42`. Wait, is that the answer to all of life's questions? :) Let's do an experiment for the next 42 days using  daily exercise goals and see what happens. 10,000 steps is the new zero. All steps above that are golden. Real celebration looks like 200 :), 400 :), 600 :), for example.

To make room for this change, you can change the way you study languages:

* (Easy) Download and listen to each 90-minute Hungarian lesson again on your cellphone.
* (Easy) Record the new vocabulary words on SoundCloud.
* (Easy) Create a playlist of the new vocabulary words for easy access.
* (Moderately easy) Write down sentences, have a native speaker review them, and then record them on SoundCloud.
* (Easy) Walk in a quiet area so you can clearly hear the recordings.

You usually have the most success exercising when you do it first thing in the morning. Adjust your wake-up time to 07:30, which is more about consistency than anything else. Workout from 07:45 to 08:15. Take a shower and eat from 08:15 to 08:30. Hop online for your language exchange. After that, the rest of your day is golden.

Since vacationing in Budapest and Serbia, I decided to change my lifestyle. Serbians eat _a lot_ of meat. After three days in Novi Sad, I was tempted to go vegan. Fortunately, that extreme feeling left after I ate green things. While in Budapest, I watched a https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBnniua6-oM[YouTube video called Sugar: The Bitter Truth], which was hauntingly powerful. The topic was familiar to me, but the discussion and diagrams about fructose digestion via the liver were new. As a result, I have eliminated sugar unless it is accompanied by natural fiber, such as a whole (small) orange rather than fresh-squeezed orange juice, and alcohol during the week from Sunday through Thursday. Initially, I tried a Monday through Friday schedule, but that proved to be too difficult given the natural tendency for people to socialize on Fridays and Saturdays. One caveat is that if I exercise intensely for more than one hour, I will take in sugar. However, that is corresponds directly with the activity level underway.

This week, I need to up my game and do more exercise. Now that I have changed my diet, my level of movement needs a boost. I have a subscription to http://dailyburn.com[Daily Burn] and will workout tonight. There, I said it. Now for the _doing_. I can choose to let myself down, or I can choose to follow through. One of my favorite trainers used the prompt, "Let's do something useful." That was such a non-threatening, motivating statement to hear. It is quite easy to be immediately more active. I biked to work today and will bike home too. That is a wonderful baseline, but I need more.

= [[20140309]]20140309 - Friedrichshain to Müggelsee

Today started out with enough sleep and two small pots of coffee. There was no need to rush out the door. Tom had already warned us about the potential for a mid-day ride due to an _n_-degree hangover. With the early morning pressure off, I started rewriting my http://thinkinfinnish.com[TiF] website for people interested in learning Finnish. "Just one more fix, just one more fix," I repeated mostly to myself. "Ok, lemme push my changes." Push after push later, I learned that Tom had already taken off from somewhere to somewhere. I put on my bike shorts. After closer examination, I took them off and threw them away; respect the riders behind you. With the temperature at 16&deg; (61&deg; F), I almost overdressed. Ben convinced me to leave the leg warmers at home, which was a good call. 

Dressed, we ride out and start out faster than I would have ridden on my own. We keep it that way. There were stretches where we rode with the cars, and an early morning roll out would eliminate so much road sharing. I had bits of golden-gate-bridge rage, which is an intolerance for dilly-dallying grannies and grampas. On the way back, one grampa seems to be haulin' ass. Then, Ben takes note, "Grampa's on an electric [bike]."

We get back during the middle of the afternoon, which leaves us plenty of time to use the rest of our day to nerd out.

It has been a long time (seven years) since I have owned `infobits.org`, and I now I own `infobits.eu`. Bit by bit, I am porting over content so I can more easily start from scratch with a new site. I am feeling kind of done with blog software Drupal or Wordpress.

= [[20140223]]20140223 - Friedrichshain to Müggelsee

I planned http://www.strava.com/routes/182746[a route on Strava] for the first
time. In actuality, my ride was a bit longer at approximately 52 km from
http://www.strava.com/activities/115433419[Friedrichshain to Müggelsee
and back]. Today's adventure gave me a chance to get lost and find my way again
several times without being pressured by time. Having lived in Berlin since May
2013, I still have much to explore.

Near the start of the ride, I noticed a cloud of water vapor from a

Also near the start of the ride, my Garmin tried repeatedly to re-route me. Its
maps are nearly impossible (and indeed very ugly) to read, especially while
riding. I was happy that the thing popped up an error message and shut off its
own beeping. As directionally challenged&mdash;due to a prior
concusion&mdash;as I am, I was relieved to know that I was on the correct road.
Because it is a bit tiring to continually stop and look at a cellphone for
route information, I decided to pay attention to the well-marked signs along
the way and make some adjustments so that my ride was a bit more brainless. I
ended up in Müggelheim, which I nicknamed "the Fairfax of Friedrichshain"
because it is a small, quiet, cute place that is likely a very easy place for
riders to meet.

The woods to the south of Müggelsee are gorgeous as they come into spring. It
is worth retracing the route and turning around rather than going around the
lake. Next time I ride alone, I will wander around the forest trails more
thoroughly and realize the idea to meditate for 5 - 10 minutes before turning
back.

The streets to the north of Müggelsee were on the boring side, except for the
frog sign:

It is clear that wealthy people live along the lake shore. Many of the houses
were large to the extent that it was not clear to me if people live in them
or if they were office buildings that looked like homes. The return trip was
full of traffic. There is a fence that separates the traffic and lake-side
walkers and joggers. Next time, I will see about being on that side of the
fence farther away from car and tram traffic.

I woke up tired and thinking, shit, I wish I could sleep a little while longer.
I checked my phone and read Brian&rsquo;s bail-out email from 06.37. It gave
me the motivation that I needed to get out of bed. I was already faster than
the slowest one! (Somehow showing up this week made me feel redeemed for having
bailed out the weekend prior.)

Ben, Tom, and Matt met up in Prenzlauer Berg to bike to Grunewald station
rather than take the S-Bahn. Aubrey and I opted for the S-Bahn and happened to
be in the same car on the way down. We chatted, she was riding to clear her
head, and I sipped her coffee as I listened. We continued chatting. At
Grunewald, the three others were at an easy-to-find station shop. As we rolled
out, I was excited to be riding again. I sensed I was not the only one. The
*temperature* was a comfortable *10&deg; C*, the wind was only somewhat
noticeable, and the cloud coverage made it easy on the eyes. We rode.

I started to get hangry at, well, lunchtime. It is clearly the beginning of the
training season (at least for me) because I was not carrying any food on me. As
a person who has ridden from San Francisco to Los Angeles twice, this was
uncharacteristic. I fed off others&rsquo; stashes throughout the day, including
part of Aubrey&rsquo;s delicious Brie sandwich. That saved me on the ride, but
it might have made Aubrey hungrier than she needed to be later on. This
having-no-food business had me thinking that I could just *cook up hot dogs and
stick them in my pockets*. It&rsquo;s the same shit you buy on the ride, so why
not just prepare it ahead of them. *Matt* mentioned a *website for cooking your
own biking food*.

Because I did not have enough real food to eat, I started considering a
bail-out point. Ben noticed that I had grown tired. &ldquo;Just 5 more
_miles_." (I speak to myself in American English.) We kept on and I used some
of my http://www.aidslifecycle.org[ALC] training to move my mind where I needed
it to go. Having enjoy several more kilometers of peaceful German countryside
of farms and migrating birds overhead,
https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-uVAx5ORIHoQ/UwB-rZwpwpI/AAAAAAAAOEk/ImlNzpvhdM4/w886-h665/14%2B-%2B1[
Aubrey&rsquo;s rear derailleur *suddenly causes her to stop*]. Her shock was
understandable. Tom shouts, &ldquo;Mechanical!&rdquo; as he and I ride on to
catch Matt who is concerned about baby duties and pushing the time away from
home even further. We cycle back the short bit to share tools and offer moral
support. Aubrey is quick to decide on the https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-ozJ8G38DMyA/UwB_R6_D8QI/AAAAAAAAOFI/phPNZtV9bLA/w524-h698-no/14+[ideal chain

doesn&rsquo;t happen everyday so I am rather giddy at the opportunity to
capture the scene of https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-adEkp0pFvlY/UwCASZAkmeI/AAAAAAAAOGY/izRU1JfAqJk/w524-h698-no/14+[moral support] and https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/--XSzhJ8IkIc/UwCAmFzl_gI/AAAAAAAAOHA/OADQo5PUEaI/w931-h698-no/14+[teamwork].

has come down from her high of having a great bike and she grows &ldquo;ti[red]
ti[red]&rdquo; for the rest of the ride. I leave my food troubles behind and
focus on her. She starts to close her eyes to capture a bit of shut-eye. Been
there, done that, get this grrrl some sugar. We keep her energized and hydrated
for the remainder of the ride. My right knee is noticeably sore and I baby it
because there is some sort of adjustment problem that I need to address.
Surprisingly, no permanent damage all around to be had. We roll into the
Brandenburg station for hot dogs, currywurst, pommes, und Bier.

Bis nächste Wochenende!
