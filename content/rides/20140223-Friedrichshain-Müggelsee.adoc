I planned http://www.strava.com/routes/182746[a route on Strava] for the first
time. In actuality, my ride was a bit longer at approximately 52 km from
http://www.strava.com/activities/115433419[Friedrichshain to Müggelsee
and back]. Today's adventure gave me a chance to get lost and find my way again
several times without being pressured by time. Having lived in Berlin since May
2013, I still have much to explore.

Near the start of the ride, I noticed a cloud of water vapor from a

Also near the start of the ride, my Garmin tried repeatedly to re-route me. Its
maps are nearly impossible (and indeed very ugly) to read, especially while
riding. I was happy that the thing popped up an error message and shut off its
own beeping. As directionally challenged&mdash;due to a prior
concusion&mdash;as I am, I was relieved to know that I was on the correct road.
Because it is a bit tiring to continually stop and look at a cellphone for
route information, I decided to pay attention to the well-marked signs along
the way and make some adjustments so that my ride was a bit more brainless. I
ended up in Müggelheim, which I nicknamed "the Fairfax of Friedrichshain"
because it is a small, quiet, cute place that is likely a very easy place for
riders to meet.

The woods to the south of Müggelsee are gorgeous as they come into spring. It
is worth retracing the route and turning around rather than going around the
lake. Next time I ride alone, I will wander around the forest trails more
thoroughly and realize the idea to meditate for 5 - 10 minutes before turning
back.

The streets to the north of Müggelsee were on the boring side, except for the
frog sign:

It is clear that wealthy people live along the lake shore. Many of the houses
were large to the extent that it was not clear to me if people live in them
or if they were office buildings that looked like homes. The return trip was
full of traffic. There is a fence that separates the traffic and lake-side
walkers and joggers. Next time, I will see about being on that side of the
fence farther away from car and tram traffic.
