The following real-world examples are intended to help you write
clearly and concisely.

--

**Before:**

"Sonification is the process of taking data and turning it into sound."

**After:**

N/A

**Rationale:** 

* The length of the sentence is ideal. The reader does not have
  to store too much information in his or her head to understand it with ease.

* The verb tense is consistent throughout. Native English speakers expect to read
  sentences that are written within the same tense. For example, if you use the
  present tense to describe an event that occurred in the past, which is possible
  and common in English, stay within to the present tense throughout the sentence.

* The definition is easy to remember.

**Before:**

"In order to generate music I want to import the EEG brainwave data into
<a href="http://overtone.github.io">Overtone</a>."

**After:**

To generate music, import the EEG brainwave data into
<a href="http://overtone.github.io">Overtone</a>.

**Rationale:**

* The "In order (to)" bit does not add value to the sentence;
  no value is lost by removing it.
* Without a comma, the phrase can cause the reader to stumble:<br/>
  "In order to generate music [that] I want ..."<br/>
  "In order to generate music, I want ..."
* The "I want to" does not add value to the sentence;
  moreover, it gets in the way. Feel free to remove it.
* The resulting instruction consisely tells the reader what to do.
