= 20130510 riding in Switzerland

the orange one
v2.0

Author: _{author}_

I’m visiting Zürich, Switzerland for a couple weeks. Of course I couldn’t leave
the bike at home, so I packed up The Orange One and put it on the plane.

My first ride was a nice solo roll around Zürichsee, then up around Üetliberg.
I got lost a couple times, but thankfully I had my phone and a pre-downloaded
map using a route I found on Strava and
http://maps.coderminus.com[http://maps.coderminus.com] on my phone.
